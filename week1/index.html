<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>I am a second year student at UCLA majoring in statistics (minoring in GIS and possibly Digital Humanities) interested in using data science and mapping to solve a wide variety of problems! I am from Irvine, California. One fun fact about me is that I used to do geography trivia competitions in middle and high school like the National Geographic Bee!

<h3> My Interest in Mapping</h3>
<p> I am interested in using mapping for social change for a wide variety of reasons. To begin with, mapping has the power to help out those who are traditionally marginalized. For example, one can use maps to help community members find local public services and to solve problems of concern in their area, thereby bringing back power to them. Unfortunately, mapping has been used to harm those most vulnerable throughout history. Maps have been used to exclude, rather than to include others. I also would like to combine my love of mapping with my interest in analyzing data to achieve this. I am really excited to learn more about how such technical tools can be applied to bring about change in the world!

<h2>My Skills</h2>
<p>I have had the opportunity of learning some data science skills as well as mapping skills in some of my previous classes. With the skills I learn in Asian-Am-191A, I hope to use these skills to bring about change. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Numpy)</li>
    <li>R</li>
    <li>Tableau</li>
    <li>ArcGIS Pro</li>
    <li>QGIS</li>
  </ul>
